# Jira Worklogger

A small tool to try to make logging time in Jira faster and easier

`wails dev` to run in dev mode (with live reloading on edits)

`wails build` to build

## How to use

* open the app
* set config (gear icon in upper left)
  * your jira username, password, and server domain name - e.g. "company.jira.com" - leave the https off
* begin logging time
  * hit start when you start work
  * log work when you finish a work session
  * nevermind to erase the current time tracking
  * or set finish time manually
* time spent is calculated based on when you hit start and stop
* track one issue at a time - this app can't multitask ***and neither can you***
